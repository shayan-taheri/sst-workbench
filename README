The Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) explores innovations 
in highly concurrent systems where the ISA, microarchitecture, 
and memory interact with the programming model and communication system. 
The package provides two novel capabilities. The first is a fully modular 
design that enables extensive exploration of an individual system 
parameter without the need for intrusive changes to the simulator. The 
second is a parallel simulation environment based on MPI. This provides 
a high level of performance and the ability to look at large systems. 
The framework has been successfully used to model concepts ranging from 
processing in memory to conventional processors connected by conventional 
network interfaces and running MPI. 

The SST software is comprised of the core framework and supported elements.
The following list identifies the elements by directory name:

SST core
SST integrated techModels: libHotSpot, libIntSim, libMcPATbeta, and libORION  
IRIS 
patterns 
PhoenixSim (not supported on Mac)
portals4
portals4_sm
scheduler
simpleComponent
SS_router
