The Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) explores innovations 
in highly concurrent systems where the ISA, microarchitecture, 
and memory interact with the programming model and communication system. 
The package provides two novel capabilities. The first is a fully modular 
design that enables extensive exploration of an individual system 
parameter without the need for intrusive changes to the simulator. The 
second is a parallel simulation environment based on MPI. This provides 
a higher level of performance and the ability to look at large systems. 
The framework has been successfully used to model concepts ranging from 
processing in memory to conventional processors connected by conventional 
network interfaces. 
 
The following external components are used. All are optional except the 
BOOST and MPI libraries.
Boost 1.54.0
DRAMSim2 2.2.2
GEM5 tag V3.1.0 from https://code.google.com/p/sst-gem5-devel.devel which was 
 a fork of gem5-stable at change set 8642:549b72de8f72 back on Dec 15 2011
OpenMPI 1.7.2
QEMU 0.12.3
QSim 0.2.1

Power models have autrophied somewhat and are in the process of being restored.

Deprecated with this release:
Zesto
Support for External components: SST/Macro, MacSim, Mpich2, and OMNeT++.
