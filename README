The Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) explores innovations 
in highly concurrent systems where the ISA, microarchitecture, 
and memory interact with the programming model and communication system. 
The package provides two novel capabilities. The first is a fully modular 
design that enables extensive exploration of an individual system 
parameter without the need for intrusive changes to the simulator. The 
second is a parallel simulation environment based on MPI. This provides 
a high level of performance and the ability to look at large systems. 
The framework has been successfully used to model concepts ranging from 
processing in memory to conventional processors connected by conventional 
network interfaces and running MPI. 
 
The SST software is comprised of the core framework and supported models.
The following list identifies the elements:
core
IRIS 
Mcniagara
Mcopteron
patterns 
PhoenixSim (not supported on Mac)
portals4
portals4_sm
scheduler
simpleClocker
simpleComponent
simpleNetwork
SS_router 
Zesto
 
The following external components are used:
Boost 1.50.0
DRAMSim2 version 2.2?
GEM5 tag V2.3 from https://code.google.com/p/sst-gem5-devel.devel which was 
forked from gem5-stable at change set 8642:549b72de8f72 back on Dec 15 2011
SST/Macro V2.3?
MacSim V1.1
Mpich2-1.4.1
OMNeT++ 4.1
OpenMPI 1.6
QSim V?

Element Support Directories:
DRAMSimC - a glue layer for interfacing to a DRAMSim2 library from another SST
 component.
event_test - test for SST/micro core
M5 - glue layer for interfacing to gem5.
macro_component - glue layer for interfacing with SST/macro.
power - technology interface directory
sstdisksim - glue directory to DiskSim (will be deprecated in next release)
