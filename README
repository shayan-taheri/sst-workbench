The Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) explores innovations 
in highly concurrent systems where the ISA, microarchitecture, 
and memory interact with the programming model and communication system. 
The package provides two novel capabilities. The first is a fully modular 
design that enables extensive exploration of an individual system 
parameter without the need for intrusive changes to the simulator. The 
second is a parallel simulation environment based on MPI. This provides 
a higher level of performance and the ability to look at large systems. 
The framework has been successfully used to model concepts ranging from 
processing in memory to conventional processors connected by conventional 
network interfaces. 
 
The following external components are used. All are optional except BOOST 
and one MPI library.
Boost 1.50.0
DRAMSim2 2.2.2
GEM5 tag V3.0.0 from https://code.google.com/p/sst-gem5-devel.devel which was 
 a fork of gem5-stable at change set 8642:549b72de8f72 back on Dec 15 2011
SST/Macro 2.4
MacSim 1.1 (Builds on all but MacOS. Test fails everywhere.)
Mpich2 1.4.1.p2 (not supported on MacOS)
OMNeT++ 4.1 (not supported on MacOS)
OpenMPI 1.6 (V1.4.4 on MacOS via Xcode)
QEMU 0.12.3
QSim SST_2.3 tag (support for zesto only)

Element Directories:
*cpu_data - directory containing an example (from Component's perspective)
 for the usage of the SST Introspection Interface
*cpu_power - directory containing a test for the SST power and thermal models
event_test - test for SST/micro core
*introspector_cpu - directory containing an example (from Introspector's
 perspective) for the usage of the SST Introspection Interface)

 introspector's perspective) for the usage of the SST Introspection Interface)
iris - Flit-level interconnection network simulator
  http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/casl/multicore.html
*libHotSpot - study thermal evolution over a long running application. It uses
  a circuit model of equivalent thermal resistors and capacitors to those 
  used within a computer component. 
  http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/HotSpot/documentation.htm
*libIntSim - a 2D integrated circuit interconnect simulator.

  optimization of multilevel interconnect networks", ICCAD '07 Proceedings 
  of the 2007 IEEE/ACM international conference on Computer-aided design, 
   pp 560-567.
*libMcPATbeta - McPAT (Multicore Power, Area, and Timing) is an integrated 
  power, area, and timing modeling framework for multithreaded, multicore, 
  and manycore architectures. 
  http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/
*libORION - suite of dynamic and leakage power models developed for various 
  architectural components of on-chip networks 
  http://projects.csail.mit.edu/cgi-bin/wiki/view/LSPgroup/OrionPage
m5C - glue layer for interfacing to gem5.
macro_component - glue layer for interfacing with SST/macro.
  http://sst.sandia.gov/about_sstmacro.html
memHierarchy - models a memory hierarchy, such as multiple cache levels. 
merlin - generic router and NIC model intended to connect to vendor-proprietary
  or other ASICs. 
messageGeneratorComponent -
patterns - allows the generation of network traffic without incurring
  the proessing and memory overhead of running a full endpoint simulator.
PhoenixSim - models properties of photonic interconnect networks including 
  propagation delay, insertion loss, extinction ratio, spectral resonant 
  profiles, area occupation, and energy dissipation. 
  http://lightwave.ee.columbia.edu/?s=research&p=phoenixsim
portals4 - Model Portals4 NIC. Portals message matching and data movement 
  is preformed by the NIC. The NIC sits between a network router and 
  bus model. The currently supported models are Gem5 and SS_router.
portals4_sm - state machine model based on injecting discrete events
*power - glue layer for interfacing to SST power, thermal and
  reliability models
propero - reads a trace file and generates standard memory events that can 
  then be passed to memHierarchy cache/memory models. Prospero also has a 
  simple trace tool that runs under the PIN binary instrumentation framework 
  to capture a memory trace.
scheduler - Scheduling, allocation, and machine models are implemented in the 
 schedComponent, and node and failure models are implemented in the nodeComponent.
simpleClockerComponent - 
simpleComponent -
simpleRNGComponent - Random Number Generator
SS_router -  models the internal crossbar and input/out queues of the
  SeaStar. Added flexibility is enabled by parameterizing queue depth,
  FLIT size and number of FLITS in a packet.
sst_mcniagara - stochastic processor model that is statistical and based 
  on a Monte Carlo technique. Niagara can model both single- and 
  multi-core processors. 
sst_mcopteron - stochastic processor model that is statistical and based
  on a Monte Carlo technique. The Opteron is presently a single-core model.
zesto - timing model based on the pre-release version of the x86 version 
  of SimpleScalar. This simulator was developed for detailed cycle-level 
  modeling of modern out-of-order pipelines. 

* - power models have autrophied somewhat and are in the process of 
    being restored.

Deprecated with this release:
DRAMSimC - a glue layer for interfacing to a DRAMSim2 library from another SST
 component.
 https://wiki.umd.edu/DRAMSim2
sstdisksim - glue directory to DiskSim (will be deprecated in next release)
