* Release V4.0.0
The changes in V4.0.0 of the Micro version of the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) are divided by area: general, the core, and integrated components.
 
General 
- SST inputs can be provided as python or xml scripts, except for Gem5. There is a new option to convert xml to python. This enhancement was the primary motivator for increasing the high order digit in the version number. Note that we plan to deprecate xml support in 2016 or so.
- The executable name changed from sst.x to sst, which loads sstsim.x. The sst binary automatically configures many of the ENV variables before calling sstsim.x.
- SST can now generate a configuration graph in dot (graphviz) format. 
- There is increased support for external Element Libraries (ie, pkg-config file).
- A new tool, SST Workbench, is provided. This GUI is a drag and drop interface that will generate input decks for the selected components. A binary is available as a separate download for Linux and Mac.
- The source code tarball is now created using make dist. This is a first step towards providing interim tarballs from the trunk that have passed all nightly tests.
 
Core 
- All SST core classes have complete Doxygen information. See the latest doxygen output from the trunk ?here or for the 4.0.0 dxoygen look ?here.
- A unit algebra feature is available from the core. 
- There is a limited API for statistics gathering and analysis. 
- There is a new Output class for use by the core and any components. 

Elements 
- All released Element Libraries have their ElementInfo structures fully populated.
- Support for the Zoltan partitioning library has been re-introduced. 
- Element library declarations have been expanded to include Parameters and Ports.
- MemHierarchy is updated with intra-node directory-base coherency and with MESI protocols.
- There are additional scheduler models for cooling-power and joint cooling-power/performance allocation using GLPK.

The following external components are used. All are optional except the 
BOOST and MPI libraries. Other versions may work, but these have been 
tested with this release.
- Boost 1.54.0 (V1.53.0 is now the minimum requirement) 
- OpenMPI 1.8 
- GLPK 4.54 
- HybridSim 2.0.0 
- NVRAMSim 2.0.0 
- Gem5 tag 4.0.0 from ?https://code.google.com/p/sst-gem5-devel.devel/ which was a fork of gem5-stable at change set 8642:549b72de8f72 back on Dec 15 2011
- QEMU 0.12.3 
- QSim 0.2.1 
- Zoltan 3.8 

Deprecated with this release are:
- cpu_data (test driver) 
- cpu_power (test driver)
- introspector_cpu (support directory)
- introspector_cpuTemperature (support directory)
- palacios
- portals4 
- power (technology interface directory)

* Release V3.0.0
This release of SST/Micro introduces a number of new features and changes.
They are grouped below by 1) core changes 2) component changes 3) new models, 
and 3) other
SST core changes:
API changes were the primary motivation for incrementing the major revision 
number. The number of APIs did not change, but the capitalization was made
consistent across the function names. Additional parameter checking and the
infrastructure to self-document components has been added. The core provides
an optional new init stage which is called between the constructor and the
setup stage. It can pass data from one component to another. It is now
possible to load a module out of a library.

Component changes:
Each SST component is now in its own C++ namespace. The SST version of GEM5
has been modified to support the new hierachical memory model.  Added
PHXsimWrap to Gem5 which links to a proprietary HMC component, phxsim.so.
The scheduler component has new scheduling and allocation algorithms, as
well as enhancements to the base component for new requirements, in particular,
resiliency.

New Models:
This release introduces new scheduler models, simple clock and network
models, a generic router model and hierarchical memory model.  The memory
hieraarchy model plugs into gem5, but instead of using gem5's memory
models (classic and ruby), memHierarchy provides snoopy based coherency and
has working atomics. (The directory based model is under development.) A new
utility a reads a trace file and generates standard memory events that 
can then be passed to the new hierachical cache/memory model.

Other:
There is a new WIKI page that explains how to install a user-level phython
version.

The individual commits/revisions (i.e. ChangeLog) since V2.3 are not provided 
as there were approximately 500 revisions committed. It would be impossible to
read and digest. The SST wiki http://www.sst-simulator.org/timeline
can be browsed for the individual revisions.

A number of issues were resolved by fixes in this release. The full
description of each issue can be found on the SST wiki at 
http://www.sst-simulator.org/report.

   Defining CC to be CXX is a fairly repulsive thing to do, but ignoring that...
   On modern versions of AC/AM, it's an error to redefine CC/CXX/etc. in an
   AM_CONDITIONAL.  Since there's no inheretence here, it's safe to just
   always set it.

Fixed a few qsim-related things in the zesto component:
  -The SDL files for qsim-lib had some errors (did they ever run successfully?) 
  -The old internal copy of the client library was still hanging around.
  -There was no mention in any documentation or anywhere else that -lqsim and
   -lqsimclient absolutely must make their way into the linker flags for
   correct behavior.

Rev 3355 moved (copied) the techModels to a new home in trunk/deps/src.  
Rev 3504 deleted the techModels from trunk/sst/core.   This Rev allows 
compile of power after the move by pointing include files to the new location.
There are, at least, two outstanding issues after this.  When power is built, 
for SST to link and begin execution, there are three .so files missing from 
the attempt which were in svn before 3504.  These should be being rebuilt 
from source, rather than cached in SVN.   The second problem which was noted 
in mid September is that the current (Mid-September and October 16th) version 
of the code and installed PowerTherm test enters a nearly infinite loop in SST.
(Failed to complete in 90 hours in September.)

* Release 2.2 of SST/Micro. 
  Support for SDL version 1 has been deprecated. 
  Added the ability to have custom partitioners and generators. 
  Deleted several deprecated directories:
    bus, cpu_PowerAndData, cpu_router_power, DRAMSimTrace,
    genericProc, introspector_dram, introspector_mesmthi,
    introductor_router, libsim_panalyzer, resil, and schedule
  Although not deleted from the development trunk, the following
    components are not provided: Mcniagara, Mcopteron, merlin, 
    mesmthi, mosaic_cpu, mosaic_nic, palacios, parser, sstdisksim, 
    and zesto. Some are not ready yet, others are missing a 
    nightly regression test.
