Release V4.0.0 (core and elements) has been built and tested with the following OS/compiler combinations.
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64-bit) with gcc v4.6.3 (We would have liked to upgrade to 14.04, but there are a number of gcc v4.8.2 compiler issues to resolve still.)
- MacOS 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) with MacPorts gcc 4.6 required for the entire build.
- MacOS 10.9.2 (Mavericks) with default LLVM (v5.x) from Xcode. If Gem5 is required, use MacPorts gcc 4.6 for the entire build.
- CentOS 6.5 with gcc V4.4.7 
- TOSS 2.1.1-3.ch5.1.1 with RHEL 6.4 (Santiago) with gcc v4.4.7 

Note: SST is only supported on 64-bit platforms.
